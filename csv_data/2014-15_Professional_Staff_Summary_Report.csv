PROFESSIONAL STAFF SUMMARY,
,
This workbook contains 2014-15 full- and part-time professional staff counts for all public schools,
"in Pennsylvania as reported by school districts, area vocational-technical schools, charter schools,",
intermediate units and state juvenile correctional institutes.,
"Average Salaries, Years of Service and Education Level are calculated for full-time staff only.",
"Salaries less than $18,500 reported for full-time staff are not considered when calculating averages.  ",
"For category (administrative, classroom teacher, coordinate/support, and other) totals and averages, a person is counted once within each category. ",
An individual holding assignments in more than one category will only be counted once in the overall (PP-Professional Personnel) totals and averages for an LEA.,
,
"Subcontracted staff are not counted, nor is their data used in calculating averages.",
"School Security staff are not counted, nor is their data used in calculating averages.  ",
,
"LEA, COUNTY, AND STATEWIDE TOTAL NOTES",
,
LEVEL TOTALS ARE DISTINCT WITHIN THE LEVEL:,
"Local Education Agency (LEA) Level: An individual is only counted once per LEA, regardless of the number of schools or buildings where she or he is employed.",
"County Level: An individual is only counted once per county, regardless of the number of LEAs where she or he is employed.",
"State Level: An individual is only counted once per state, regardless of the number of LEAs or counties where she or he is employed.",
,
THE EFFECT OF CATEGORIES ON TOTALS AND AVERAGES,
"An individual, and the individual's characteristics (salary, experience, and education) are counted (for counts) or considered (for averages) once in each category in which the individual has one or more assignments.  ",
,The exception to this is where an individual is employed by more than one LEA.  The characteristics reported by each LEA are considered separately in calculating averages statewide or within a county.
"The sum of individuals in each category may be greater than the count of individuals in all categories, due to individuals holding assignments in more than one category.  ",
