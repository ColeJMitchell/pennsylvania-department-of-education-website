"* Proficiency summary data do not include students who were resident of the state after October 1, home schooled, excluded from state aggregation, EL students who were enrolled for less than one year in US school, students who did not attempt, or COVID-19 exclusion. Proficiency percentages may not add up to 100 due to rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,
** Note that fewer students participated in Keystone Exams than in past years. A comparison to 2018-19 is included in the table below to demonstrate that difference. 2021 results do not reflect a representative sample of the student population. This phenomenon is likely to make any cross-year comparison of proficiency inaccurate.  ,,,,,,,,,,,
