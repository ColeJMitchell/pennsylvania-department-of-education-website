"This workbook contains low income data and enrollments for all publicly funded schools in Pennsylvania as reported by school districts, area vocational-technical schools, charter schools, intermediate units, and state-operated educational facilities. Local education agencies were asked to report those students who were enrolled and attending as of the first business day in October of each school year. SJCI data is not included, but should be considered 100% economically disadvantaged."
